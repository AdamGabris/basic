Your program brok,
as cold and frail as winter
your bad code is.
- Christian

It can be fixed,
just like the bird's in springtime
hopeful I am.
- Tony B

Syllables, lost,
Haiku, a mystery to me,
Empty page, I write.
- Jose

My head hurts alot.
Coding is the reason why.
But im having fun.
- Ottar

Dont wanna do this
Programming is hard for me
I will do my best.
- Cathrine

I write, erase, rewrite
Erase again, and then
A poppy blooms.
